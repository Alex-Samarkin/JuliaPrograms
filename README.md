# Julia Basics Learning Series

This repository contains a series of educational programs introducing the Julia programming language. Each part builds upon the previous one to provide a comprehensive introduction to Julia.

## Parts in the Series

### Part 1: Introduction to the Language (julia_basics_part1.jl)
- Basic syntax and variable assignment
- Data types (integers, floats, strings, booleans, complex numbers, etc.)
- String operations and interpolation
- Input/output operations
- Control flow statements (if/else, loops)
- Function definitions and usage

### Future Parts (Planned):
- Part 2: Collections, Arrays, and Advanced Types
- Part 3: Plotting and Visualization, External Libraries
- Part 4: Creating Custom Modules and Packages

## Running the Code

To run the first part of the series:

```bash
julia julia_basics_part1.jl
```

## About Julia

Julia is a high-level, high-performance dynamic programming language designed for numerical and scientific computing. It combines the ease of use of languages like Python with the performance of compiled languages like C++.

## Key Features Covered in Part 1

- **Dynamic Typing**: Variables can change types during runtime
- **Multiple Dispatch**: Functions can have different implementations based on argument types
- **Built-in Data Types**: Rich set of primitive and composite types
- **Functional Programming**: Support for higher-order functions and anonymous functions
- **Exception Handling**: Robust error handling mechanisms
- **String Interpolation**: Elegant way to embed expressions in strings

Each concept is thoroughly commented to help newcomers understand both the syntax and the underlying concepts.
